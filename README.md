# Technical Test

__Opportunity No. 44161__

## Overview

This test is used to evaluate your technical ability and proficiency in writing code and modelling business problems. We will review not only your output, but also the process that you used to arrive at your solution. 

> [!NOTE]
> The problem presented here is representative of the __typical__ problem the position would work on. In the interest of fairness and out of respect for your time, a simplified version of the problem is presented. We recommend you spend no more than 5 hours on this exercise. 


> [!CAUTION]
> If you choose to use an AI tool to prepare your submission, you must disclose what tool and how you used it. Submissions that fail to disclose their use of AI will be disqualified. 


## Challenge

For this exercise, you will use data from the City of Winnipeg's Open Data Portal. You should use the [Assessment dataset](https://data.winnipeg.ca/Assessment-Taxation-Corporate/Assessment-Parcels/d4mq-wa44) but can also use any other dataset on the open data portal. 

Build an automated valuation model to predict the assessed value of a residential property based on the property features (e.g., number of rooms) using R or Python. 

Your task is to:

1. Create an automated valuation model from scratch to predict the assessed value of properties in Winnipeg. 

*How you go about the task* is important and we are paying attention to process. You will see some template code has already been started in the repository. You can use this code and built off it. Use proper software development workflows - as if you are collaborating with a colleague. Your code should be well structured and tidy. 

You are free to make assumptions about the business problem and needs - document these assumptions clearly. 

2. Finally, you should prepare a short summary of what you did and how you have approached the business problem. You should provide an accessible summary of your work in bullet points and plain language, as well as a more detailed description in standard prose. Word limits apply (see below).

## Expected Outcomes

1. A simple automated valuation model to predict the value of a residential property in Winnipeg, with code and other materials as needed to reproduce results.
2. Descriptions of your work for two different audiences.
   
   (a) Accessible description of the work for a non-technical client,  not exceeding **200 words.**
   
   (b) A more detailed description of the work with technical specifics justifying your modelling choices that does not exceed **500 words.**

> [!NOTE]
> Reproducibility is important. We may run your code to verify your solution. Furthermore, you must only use free (no cost) and open source tools in your submission to promote reproducibility.
